# A simple implementation of DyClee in Python

DyClee is a novel algorithm for clustering non-stationary data streams which currently is present in the literature but hasn't yet been implemented.

DyClee's paper can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320319301992) and its implementation it's said to be available [here](https://homepages.laas.fr/louise/drupal/node/36) soon.
